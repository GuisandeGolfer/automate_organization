### Script Overview

1. First, we import all the necessary modules
    - `os, shutil`
    - `time`
    - `logging`
    - `watchdog`
2. Next, we enter in our folder locations that we want to have our files moved to.
    - `dest_dir_onedrive_documents`
    - `dest_dir_images`
    - `dest_dir_videos`
    - `dest_dir_documents`
4. Then, we create our "MoverHandler" python class that will hold the methods for checking any new files added to `source_dir`
5. Lastly, we instaniate our `observer` object from the `watchdog` module
    - the object needs a `PATH` to watch for changes, an `event_handler` to use to handle those changes in path
    - and whether you want it to recursively check the `path` that is given.
